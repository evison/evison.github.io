        <h2>Alibaba Personalized Re-Ranking Dataset</h2>
        <ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a real-world e-commerece dataset from Alibaba about user clicks in the phone shopping interface. Each time user scrolls the phone screen, it will trigger a request, and in each request, the system will return a list of 30 recommended items. This dataset recorded which of the items in the list are clicked by the user as well as the item features. Execept for traditional recommendation research, this dataset can also support research on re-ranking algorithms, RL recommendation algorithms, slate recommendation algorithms and more. For more details please see the following paper on RecSys 2019. The dataset can be downloaded from this GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/hf4Academic/PRM" target="_blank">download</a>).</p>

        <h2>Alibaba E-commerce User Behavior Dataset</h2>
        <ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a user behavior dataset from Alibaba E-commerce platform, which was used in the research on Value-aware Recommendation based on Reinforcement Profit Maximization. The following is one short paragraph from the paper which can help to understand the format of the datafile. The dataset can be downloaded from the following URL: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OtIC8eiDkzoWCTtaUZHcb7eB-bUmtTT/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">download</a>.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In our recommendation platform, items are shown in cascade on a mobile App one by one. Each time the user initiates a request, 50 items are recommended to him/her. As user scrolls down the list and have seen all 50 items, a new request is triggered. This process is repeated until the user leaves the App or returns to the top of the cascade, labelled as "exit" in Figure 2 of the paper. We use an ID called "pageid" to distinguish diferent requests in this interaction, similar to the concept of "page" to a search engine. As the user and the system interact with each other, the system learns how to respond to the state to obtain an optimized accumulative reward.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Detailed format of the dataset is as follows. Each line of the dataset contains 15 columns. The meaning of each column is:<br/>
            column 1: The id of returned page for the current request, which ranges from 0 to 11.  Note that for each page, we return 50 items to the user.<br/>
            column 2: The hour when the request is launched by the user, in 24hr format, e.g., 2 means 2am, 14 means 2pm.<br/>
            column 3-5: The features used to profile the user which includes age-level, gender and the level of purchase power. Note that for anonymous purpose, we do not provide detailed ID for each user, instead, we use tuple [age-level, gender, purchase power] to represent a user.<br/>
            column 6-14: The item-sepcific features/labels. We concat the values of 50 returned items belonging to a request toghether to form a list and separat them by comma. <br/>
            More specifically:<br/>
            column 6: The concatenated list of **position** for each item in the returned list, which ranges from 0 to 600 (12pages * 50items/page).<br/>
            column 7-9: The concatenated list of **predicted ctr/cvr/price** for each item in the returned list.<br/>
            column 10-12: The concatednated list of **isclcik/iscart/isfav** for each item in the returned list to indicate whether the item is cliked/added to cart/added to whishlist by the user.<br/>
            column 13: The concatednated list of **purchase amount** for each item in the returned list. For example, 0.0 means that the user does not purchase this item. 12.0 means that the user spends 12 Yuan on this item.<br/>
            column 14: The concatednated list of **an optinal powerful feature** of the item which can be used as one dimension of the "state" vector in RL.<br/>
            column 15: To indicate whether the current page is the last page browsed by the user.<br/>
            So column 1-9,14 can be used to generate **state** in the paper. Column 10-13 can be used to calclulate the **reward** in the paper. Column 15 represents the **terminal** indicator of RL in the paper.<br/>

        <h2>E-Commerce Conversational Search and Recommendation Dataset</h2>
        <ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This is a semi-synthetic dataset for conversational search and recommendation in e-commerce. Basically, each conversation is constructed from a piece of user-item review. We extract product features and user opinions on these features from each review, and then a conversation is constructed based on a system ask - user response manner. Specifically, the system asks about each feature according to the order that the features apprear in the review, and the sentence commenting on that feature is considered as the user's response. We constructed conversations in four domains, which are CDs_and_Vinyl, Cell_Phones_and_Accessories, Electronics, and Kindle_Store. It should be noted that not all of the response sentences are good in terms of quality, but they show user's opinion (or requirement) on the corresponding features. The features are extracted based on our <i>Sentires: Phrase-level Sentiment Analysis Toolkit</i>, which can be downloaded in the <i>software</i> page of this website. If a researcher would like to increase the quality of the conversations (which will sacrifice the quantity though), he or she could leverage this toolkit and change the parameter settings to extract higher quality (but less in terms of quantity) feature and opinion words. The dataset can be downloaded by clicking here (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kugsfgkwksosesh/Datasets%28Conversational-Search-and-Recommendation%29.zip?dl=0" target="_blank">download</a>), and the code of the paepr can be downloaded by clicking here (<a href="/attach/conversation.zip" target="_blank">download</a>).</p>

        <h2>Phrase-level Sentiment Labeled Reviews</h2>
        <ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This dataset contains the reviews of two domains, which are restaurant reviews and digital cameras. We extract all of the product feature word to user opinion word pairs (e.g. service | good, price | reasonable, etc) from each of the reviews, as well as the sentiment polarity of these pairs. The methodology of sentiment polarity labelling and feature-opinion pair extraction are presented in [1] and [2] respectively, and this dataset is used for explainable recommendation in [3]. We also provide the toolkit for extracting such product feature and user opinion words from arbitrary (English or Chinese) textual corpa, for detail, please refer to the "Sentires" toolkit under the Software tab of my homepage.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">The labeled dianping dataset can be downloaded at here (<a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1zsWMU" target="_blank">download</a>) with password "ouk2", and the labeled DC review dataset can be downloaded here (<a href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1bnGlVdl" target="_blank">download</a>) with the password "tier"; The extraction passwords for the zip files are both "yongfeng.me". A brief description of the data format is as follows:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A user review is formatted as an XML entry of the form:<br/>
                &lt;DOC&gt;<br/>
                userid  itemid  flavor_rating  environment_rating  service_rating<br/>
                review_text<br/>
                feature-opinion pairs matched in the review_text, each of the form [feature_word,  opinion_word, sentiment_polarity, times_of_ occurrence, reversed_or_not]<br/>
                &lt;/DOC&gt;<br/>
                e.g. [service, good, +1, 1, Y]  means that the pair 'service | good' is matched for once in the review, and the pair itself represents a positive sentiment (+1), however, it is reversed (Y means that it is indeed reversed, and N is not reversed) by a negation word (e.g. 'not'), so the final sentiment of this pair in this review would be negative.</p>
